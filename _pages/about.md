From urban planning practice to AI-driven generative research.
------

I work on AI-driven urban generation and spatial reasoning, with a focus on how generative models can participate in urban planning processes rather than merely producing predictive outputs.

My research integrates urban planning knowledge, geospatial data, and deep generative models (e.g., diffusion models, GANs, and neural 3D representations) to study land-use configuration, POI-driven urban functions, population distribution, and 3D urban scenes.

I aim to build generative systems that are not only technically effective, but also interpretable, multi-scale, and meaningful for real planning scenarios.

Working with research institutions on real-world urban development challenges.
------
I am currently collaborating with urban research and planning institutions(CAUPD) on research topics related to urban development and construction processes, with a particular focus on how different production, living, and ecological elements interact and evolve within cities.

These collaborations are closely connected to real-world planning practices and data environments, involving the integration of multi-modal urban datasets such as POIs, land-use maps, infrastructure networks, population data, and environmental indicators. Through these projects, I aim to explore how AI-driven generative and analytical methods can support a deeper understanding of urban spatial structure and development mechanisms.

Looking ahead, I plan to further develop planning-oriented multi-modal urban datasets and generative modeling frameworks that link urban design, land-use configuration, and spatial decision-making. I am actively seeking collaborators from AI, urban computing, geography, and planning who are interested in generative models, spatial reasoning, or real-world urban applications.
